Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
  No README file. Could possibly use another commit or two?

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
  Yes it was.

Were branching and looping used effectively?
  Looks good to us.

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?
  Bootstrap was used for the form. No CSS though.

Is the site user-friendly?
  It is. Could maybe fix how results are 'appended' without refreshing page.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
  Two of your spec tests do not pass. Maybe check to see if your code later broke them and remove them if they are not needed any longer.
